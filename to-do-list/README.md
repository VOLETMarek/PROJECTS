# ‚ò∫Ô∏è To Do List ‚ò∫Ô∏è

The goal here is to create a todo list ! ü§ì We'll need to start by breaking down the interface to envision the future components to be implemented. After that, we will handle the structure and SCSS for each component.

## Table of contents

- [The challenge](#the-challenge)
- [My process](#my-process)

## The challenge : 

- Create components
- Manage styles with sass (we'll see about variables and mixins later)
- App component need to be used in the form of classes for this challenge
- Use props
- Use controlled field
- Use state
- Use spreadOperator
- Use Tasks.js (this is the default list of tasks when arriving on the page)

Later, we will handle the case for checking a task, and we will also manage task sorting (unchecked tasks at the top and vice versa).

## My process :
