## The challenge : 

### Intégration des maquettes

Using the provided wireframes, we'll have to **create a basic HTML/CSS integration** of the homepage using Bootstrap.

The tasks include:

* Analyzing the provided documents to support our work. The **wireframes** will be particularly helpful, but the **Specifications Document (CDC)** can also provide guidance!
* Considering *mobile-first* and *responsive design*.
* Building the HTML structure of the homepage (without pagination links or footer icons).
* Using Bootstrap and its components to create an initial integration. Ideally, *no custom CSS* should be used, only Bootstrap, to establish a *working foundation* for the rest of the integration.

### Bonus

* Adding pagination below the article list using the **Pagination** component.
* Adding social media icons in the footer.
* If we cannot find the exact same icons, it's important that they represent the same concepts as shown in the wireframes !
