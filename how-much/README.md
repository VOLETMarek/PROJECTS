# ðŸ’° Currency Converter ðŸ’°

The goal here is to create a currency converter using React for the first time ! ðŸ‘Œ
The base amount is 1 euro, and when we click on a currency, we want to display the conversion result in the footer. We also want to add an "=" button to toggle the visibility of the currency list, and implement a currency search field. Default currency is USD.
